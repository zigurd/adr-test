# Transparent Proxy + VPN

### Issue

We want to create an architecture similar to the way we think a particular connection sharing app works

 + Pass more kinds of protocols than the PoC's HTTP proxy
 + Gain compatibility with tunnel encryption
 + Avoid requiring a cloud-based exit node

### Decision

Decided this is a viable architecture

### Status

Decided. Being implemented
